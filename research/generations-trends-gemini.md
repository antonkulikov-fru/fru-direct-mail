### Generational Giving Profile (2024/2025 Estimates)

The following table breaks down the demographics, their financial footprint in the nonprofit sector, and their channel preferences. *(Note: Generation Alpha accounts for the remaining ~11% of the US population but is not yet a major factor in financial giving).*

| Generation | Est. Share of US Population | Share of Total US Giving | Preferred Giving Channels (Online vs. Checks/Mail) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Silent Generation** (Before 1946) | ~5% | ~15% | **Heavily Offline:** ~75% Checks/Mail. This group gives highly concentrated, large gifts and strongly prefers paper checks. |
| **Baby Boomers** (1946–1964) | ~21% | ~41% | **Mixed, Lean Offline:** ~60% Checks/Mail, 40% Online. They are the financial engine of philanthropy. Direct mail frequently prompts their gifts, even if fulfilled online. |
| **Generation X** (1965–1980) | ~20% | ~23% | **Mixed, Lean Online:** ~60% Online, 40% Checks/Mail. High adoption of recurring online giving and employer matching programs. |
| **Millennials** (1981–1996) | ~22% | ~14% | **Heavily Online:** ~80% Online/Mobile. Heavily influenced by social media, peer-to-peer campaigns, and digital crowdfunding. |
| **Generation Z** (1997–2012) | ~21% | ~2% | **Almost Exclusively Digital:** 90%+ Online/App. Currently, they give small digital micro-donations or donate their time rather than large financial sums. |

### The Macro Trends: 2010 vs. 2025

To justify your roadmap, you have to look at how giving has structurally changed over the last 15 years. 

* **2010 Landscape:** Online giving was in its infancy, accounting for roughly 5% to 7% of total fundraising revenue. Direct mail and checks were the undisputed kings of everyday fundraising, and virtually all major gifts were paper-based. 
* **2025 Landscape:** Online giving now represents roughly 15% to 20% of *total overall revenue*, but it accounts for the **vast majority of individual transaction volume**.
* **The "Fewer Donors, Larger Gifts" Trend:** Since 2010, the total *dollars* donated to charities has hit record highs, but the *number of everyday donors* has steadily declined. Philanthropy is becoming increasingly top-heavy. Nonprofits are relying on a shrinking pool of older, wealthier donors making larger contributions.

### Strategic Takeaways: Checks vs. Online Checkout

As an impartial platform provider, here is the reality of your two options based on the hard data:

**The Case for Processing Checks (Capturing Present Value)**
* **Following the Money:** Baby Boomers and the Silent Generation account for over 56% of all charitable dollars. Because they write larger gifts, they use checks to avoid the 2% to 3% credit card processing fees that diminish their impact. 
* **Major Gifts:** If a donor wants to give a nonprofit $5,000 or $10,000, they are rarely doing it via an online checkout form. By refusing to process checks, you risk locking your platform out of the highest-value transactions and alienating older major donors.

**The Case for Leading the Online Charge (Building for the Future)**
* **Operational Efficiency:** Processing checks requires manual data entry, physical security, and bank reconciliation—creating heavy administrative overhead for nonprofits. Moving donors online frees up nonprofit staff to focus on actual relationship building.
* **Retention:** Online recurring giving (monthly subscriptions) has a dramatically higher donor retention rate than annual direct-mail check appeals. 
* **Demographic Inevitability:** Gen X and Millennials now make up the largest block of the workforce. Their wealth is growing, and they expect frictionless, one-click online checkouts. 

**The Bottom Line**
If your platform targets grassroots, high-volume/low-dollar organizations (like political campaigns, local mutual aid, or younger demographics), leading the charge to **100% online is the right move**. 

However, if your platform targets established nonprofits that rely on major gifts, capital campaigns, or legacy donors, **you must build check processing capabilities**. Forcing a 75-year-old major donor to use an online checkout for a large gift will likely result in the nonprofit losing that donation—and ultimately blaming your platform.
