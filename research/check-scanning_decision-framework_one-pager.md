# Decision Framework: Invest in Check Scanning vs. Lead Digital Migration

## Executive Question

Should we invest in building check scanning capabilities (and monetize
via commission), or focus on accelerating donor migration from mailed
checks to digital checkout?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 1. Strategic Reality

-   Check donations are declining but still disproportionately represent
    older, high-value donors.
-   Many nonprofits use lockbox/caging centers, while others run
    in-house scanner + CRM batch workflows.
-   Per-check economics and operating models vary by organization and
    must be validated in-account.
-   Exception handling (USD, post-dated, unscannable cheques, mailed
    card data) can be a major source of operational cost.
-   Charging commission on checks introduces pricing friction.

Therefore: Scanning alone is not a compelling value proposition.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 2. Core Decision Criteria

Before investing, answer:

1.  What % of revenue in our ICP comes from mailed checks?
2.  What % of check donors already exist in CRM with email?
3.  What is the LTV difference between check-only vs. digital donors?
4.  What is realistic migration elasticity (% convertible to digital)?
5.  Does controlling check flow unlock broader fintech strategy?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 3. When Check Scanning Makes Sense

Only invest if at least ONE of these is true:

### A. Revenue Acceleration

-   Faster deposit time materially improves cash flow.
-   Faster receipts measurably improve donor retention.

### B. Digital Conversion Engine

-   You can capture identity (email match, form redesign, enrichment).
-   You can convert 15--30% of check donors to digital over 12--24
    months.
-   Migration increases lifetime value or recurring adoption.

### C. Operational Simplification

-   You eliminate manual reconciliation or headcount.
-   You unify multi-entity, multi-bank complexity.

### D. Strategic Control

-   You need infrastructure ownership to enable embedded finance,
    treasury visibility, or future financial products.

If none apply → Do not build scanning.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 4. Pricing Reality

Commission on checks is weak positioning because:
- Nonprofits often perceive checks as already-captured revenue.
- % fees feel like taxation on legacy donors.
- Existing processes (outsourced or in-house) are usually judged on
  reliability and controls, not optimization.

Better models:
- Flat SaaS add-on
- Bundled within payment processing
- Performance-based (digital migration uplift)
- Free scanning, monetize downstream digital growth

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 5. Strategic Paths

## Path A --- Defensive: Universal Processor

Support every channel including checks. Pros: No revenue leakage. Cons:
Lower margins, higher operational complexity.

## Path B --- Offensive: Migration Engine

Use direct mail + QR + personalized URLs to convert upstream. Build
identity capture + recurring onboarding. Pros: Higher margin,
future-proof positioning. Cons: Requires behavior change strategy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 6. Recommended Decision Rule

Build check scanning ONLY IF:

-   Check revenue share \> 25--30% in target enterprise segment AND

-   20% migration to digital is realistically achievable OR

-   Infrastructure control is strategically required

Otherwise: Invest in digital-first conversion mechanics and let legacy
lockbox systems persist during natural sunset.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Final Framing

This is not a "feature" decision. It is a capital allocation decision.

Are we:

1)  Replacing a commoditized bank function? OR
2)  Building a donor migration and fintech control layer?

Choose accordingly.
