# Capital Allocation Evidence Backlog (Direct Mail Support)

## Goal
Close the remaining evidence gaps required for a strategic investment decision on check handling vs migration-led growth.

## Current evidence quality
Strong:
- Macro trend direction (check decline, online growth).
- Generational giving concentration and digital preference signals.

Weak:
- Account-level economics and operational baselines.
- Measured migration elasticity in our ICP.
- Competitor SLA and pricing comparables at implementation detail level.
- Exception-mix and controls burden in in-house gift-processing workflows.

## Must-have evidence before final decision

| Question | Required metric | Collection method | Decision impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| How check-heavy is our ICP by revenue? | % revenue via mailed checks by segment | CRM + finance extracts across pilot accounts | Sets scale of legacy exposure |
| Are check donors digitally reachable? | % check donors with valid email/mobile | Identity audit and deliverability checks | Sets migration addressable base |
| Can we migrate meaningfully without revenue loss? | Mail-to-online conversion lift and net revenue retention | Controlled pilots by donor segment | Validates migration thesis |
| Is intake quality sufficient across models? | Match rate, exception rate, time-to-post | Lockbox/caging file QA + in-house operational logs | Determines build-vs-partner pressure |
| Do economics favor owning rails? | Fully loaded cost per check path vs partner model | Finance model with ops/risk overhead | Tests proprietary scanning case |
| Do outcomes improve donor value? | 12-month repeat and recurring adoption after migration | Cohort tracking | Validates long-term ROI |
| How heavy is manual controls burden? | Manual touches per batch, maker-checker cycle time, rework rate | Time-motion study in gift-processing teams | Quantifies workflow automation opportunity |
| How much volume sits in exceptions? | % USD, post-dated, unscannable, mailed card rejections | Batch and exception queue analysis | Sizes requirements for exception orchestration |

## Pilot program design (recommended)
- Run 90-120 day pilots across 3-5 nonprofit archetypes.
- Segment by donor age proxy, gift size, and channel response path.
- Include at least one in-house scanner+CRM workflow account and one outsourced lockbox/caging account.
- Track both conversion and protection metrics:
  - conversion: online completion, recurring uptake,
  - protection: check revenue retention, donor complaint rate.

## Decision gates (non-final, evidence-driven)
Proceed to larger build investment only if pilots show:
- measurable migration lift without material legacy revenue loss,
- improved donor matching and reconciliation performance,
- unit economics that beat partner-only approach after full operational loading.

## Deliverables to prepare next
- Account-level scorecards (one page per pilot org).
- Sensitivity model for 3 strategic paths (partner-first, hybrid, own rails).
- Risk register for compliance, operations, and donor-experience failure modes.
