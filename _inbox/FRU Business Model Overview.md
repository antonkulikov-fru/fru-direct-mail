# How FundraiseUp Fits into the Giving Ecosystem

FundraiseUp is not a fundraising channel, a payment processor, or a donor CRM.

FundraiseUp is the **donation execution and orchestration layer** that sits between organizations and their donation infrastructure.

## The ecosystem, simplified

In modern fundraising, three things are often confused but fundamentally different:

### 1. Channels — where donor intent originates

Examples: website traffic, email, social, direct mail, in-person events, phone.

### 2. Execution surfaces — where a donation is completed

Examples: website donation forms, virtual terminals, tap-to-pay devices.

### 3. Donation models — how a donation is structured

Examples: campaigns, peer-to-peer fundraising, memberships, multi-item (“cart”) donations.

These dimensions are independent:

- A campaign can run across many channels
- A channel can lead to different execution surfaces
- An execution surface can support multiple donation models

## FundraiseUp’s role

FundraiseUp operates **between organizations and their donation infrastructure**, providing a consistent way to:

- execute donations across different execution surfaces
- support multiple donation models
- integrate with external partners (payment processors, matching providers, DAFs, canvassing tools)
- ensure accurate attribution, reporting, and receipts

FundraiseUp **does not**:

- generate donor demand
- own fundraising channels
- replace payment processors
- own the organization’s donor relationship

Instead, FundraiseUp **orchestrates donation execution**, allowing organizations to use many channels and partners without fragmentation or loss of consistency.

## Donor experience

In addition to organization-facing tooling, FundraiseUp provides a **donor experience layer** that exists _after_ donation execution.

This donor experience allows donors to:

- view their donation history
- access receipts and tax documents
- manage recurring donations

It is **not** a fundraising channel and **not** a marketing surface.

It exists because FundraiseUp is the only system that can reliably aggregate donations across execution surfaces and partners.

## Why this framing matters

This model provides a stable foundation for:

- **Product strategy** — identifying where FundraiseUp creates leverage (execution, orchestration, consistency)
- **Metrics trees** — focusing on execution quality, conversion, reliability, and coverage
- **Market research** — separating channel dynamics from execution constraints
- **Roadmapping** — understanding which surfaces or donation models meaningfully expand capability
- **Partnerships** — clarifying responsibility boundaries with processors and vendors

It also prevents common misconceptions:

- “Supporting a channel” ≠ owning demand
- “Adding an execution surface” ≠ supporting all donation models
- “Improving donor experience” ≠ owning the donor relationship

---

## One-sentence summary

**FundraiseUp enables organizations to execute donations consistently across channels, execution surfaces, and partners — without owning the channels or the donor relationship themselves.**
