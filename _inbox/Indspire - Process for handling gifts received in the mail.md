**THE MAIL MADE BY CASH, CHEQUE OR CREDIT CARD**

**I. PURPOSE**

This procedure contains guidelines for handling and processing donations made to Indspire by cash, cheque and credit card that are received in the mail. 

**IV. DEFINITIONS**

Raiser’s Edge: a cloud-based fundraising customer relationship management (CRM) tool   
CIBC Banking Tool: an online banking tool that the Donor Relations and Gift Processing Team uses to deposit cheques directly into the CIBC Donor Account, and generate reports about our deposits, which are used to reconcile with the deposit information input into Raiser’s Edge  
Cheque Scanner: the cheque scanner used to deposit donations directly into the CIBC fundraising bank account 

**V. RESPONSIBILITIES**

The Donor Relations and Gift Processing Coordinators will process donations received in the mail. The Donor Relations and Gift Processing Coordinators are required to always ensure the confidentiality and security of donor information. 

The Database Manager will ensure compliance to this procedure. 

**VI. PROCEDURES**

1. **Picking up and sorting Indspire mail** 

* One of the Donor Relations and Gift Processing Coordinators collects the mail from our mailbox in the lobby or the front office.   
* The person who picked up the mail sorts the mail, distributing any non-BRE donations to Michelle’s desk or put the non-BRE mail/cheque(s) in Michelle’s folder inside the Donor Relations filing cabinet.   
* That same person then brings the remaining mail into the Donor Services area, counts the number of pieces of mail and logs this into the Daily Mail Log sheet. 

2. **Opening the mail and sorting by donation type** 

* The Donor Relations and Gift Processing Coordinator will open each envelope and sort the contents by type of communication or donation. Inside each envelope could be one of a few things, including but not limited to:   
  * A donation made by cash, cheque or credit card that can be immediately deposited  
  * USD cheques – they cannot be scanned, they need to be deposited at the bank in person  
  * A post-dated cheque   
  * A notice from an organization with updated information (ex. change of contact information)   
  * Communication from a donor (i.e., updated mailing information, notice that a donor has passed away, a personal note or a completed survey)   
  * Mail for another staff member/department that was not addressed to them personally   
    

When opening the mail, the Donor Relations and Gift Processing Coordinator will create piles for each type of contents: donations of cash, donations made by credit card, donations made by cheque, Donations made in USD, post-dated cheques, and other (to include all other forms of mail that are not donations). Once in piles, each one will need to be counted and totaled.  (It can also be useful to sort your piles by appeal – it makes entry faster and less prone to entry error).

* When the envelope contains donor information (ex. there is a return address on the envelope), the envelope must be shredded.   
* Secure all cash, credit card information, and post-dated cheques (following the process outlined below) before beginning your daily deposit. 

**3A. Donations made by cheque**   
 

* When the volume of cheques received in the mail is high: divide up your cheques and matching coupons into smaller batches, so each batch has a maximum of 25 cheques/matching coupons.   
* Make your batches into two piles: one for the cheques and one for the reply coupons. Keep them in the same order (i.e., so the cheque on the bottom of the pile is the same as the coupon on the bottom of the pile). Confirm that the cheque is made out to Indspire. Confirm that the amount on the cheque matches the amount indicated on the reply coupon. When it doesn’t, write the correct amount on the reply coupon (the amount written on the cheque). **Write the cheque number and cheque date on the reply coupon**.   
* Using the adding machine, create a tape of each pile and ensure that they match up. Keep each tape with each pile as you go along.  
* Deposit the cheques in the Donor Account using the cheque scanner, following the Cheque Scanner Help Guide. When the cheques have been deposited, save the   
  “Image Deposit Items Detail” report in V:\\Donor Services\\Gift Processing\\Bank Deposit Report\\Image Deposit Items Detail Report\\Current Fiscal Year\\Current month using the naming convention Deposit Details\_Batch number (ex. April 3, 2025 \- $450.00 Batch 25-716 Control Report 6N Office Cheque Batch)   
* Print the first page(s) of this report that contain a summary of the cheques deposited. Wrap this report around the coupons and log the deposit total in the eCheque Deposit Log (see below).   
* Take the cheques out of the cheque scanner.  Include the adding tape.  
* In the filing cabinet, there is a section of files for cheques that have been deposited – one for each day of the month. Our policy is to shred cheques after one month, so check the file for that date (ex. if today is May 2nd, cheque the file marked “2”) and shred any cheques in the file from the previous month. Place the cheques that were just deposited in the now-empty file.   
* Using the coupons from that deposit, enter the gifts following the “Gift Batching in Raiser’s Edge” business rule into the batch you created in Raiser’s Edge.   
* Once you have entered all the gifts, save and close the batch. Bring the coupons and CIBC deposit details report that you printed to the other Donor Relations and Gift Processing Coordinators for review and approval.  
* The Donor Relations and Gift Processing Coordinators will verify that the amount deposited to CIBC matches the total amount input in that Raiser’s Edge batch. The Donor Relations and Gift Processing Coordinators will also verify that all the data was entered correctly into Raiser’s Edge.   
* Once the Donor Relations and Gift Processing Coordinators has approved the batch, they will commit the batch.  Print the committed batch summary from Raiser’s Edge. Highlight the batch number at the top of the document, and wrap it around the CIBC deposit details report so the batch number is visible at the top of the bundle. File this bundle in the filing cabinet in the Donor Services area, by batch number. 

**3B. Post-dated cheques** 

* When a post-dated cheque arrives in the mail, the Donor Relations and Gift Processing Coordinator that is opening the mail will file the cheque in the post-dated cheque section of the filing cabinet located in the Donor Services area by post-date (in order of the date it should be deposited on).   
* On the date the cheque has been post-dated for, that cheque and any other post-dated cheques, will be included in a separate batch. This batch may also include cash that has been deposited and cheques that would not scan so were deposited at the bank. Refer to step 6 for completing this batch of donations. 

**3C. Cheques that won’t scan or cannot be read** 

* When a cheque will not scan and cannot be deposited using the cheque scanner, that cheque will be removed from that batch of cheques   
* In the Bank Scanner, delete the cheque that will not scan/cannot be read from the deposit.   
* Update both adding tapes, making note of the reason  
* Add any cheques that would not scan to the bank deposit file, to be included in the weekly deposit at the bank. These cheques will be included in the Raiser’s Edge batch for “other” payment types – refer to step 6 for completing this batch of donations. 

**3D. Cheques with errors**

* Should there be a cheque that isn’t signed or otherwise cannot be processed, set aside the coupon and the cheque and send a DSL to the donor.

**4\. Donations made by cash** 

* If the cash came with a coupon, the amount is written on the coupon with the word “CASH” (ex. $5 CASH). If the cash did not come with a coupon, the amount is written on the envelope it came in, along with the coding for the gift (campaign, fund and appeal). Similar to the process you follow for cheques, you make one pile of cash and one pile with the coupons/envelopes.  
* As soon as you open cash, the cash is double counted by the other Donor Relations and Gift Processing Coordinator who double counts the cash, and then initials the coupon/envelope it came in.   
* The cash is then placed in the bank deposit file in the filing cabinet located in the secure Donor Services area.   
* Cash is deposited once a week by one of the Donor Relations and Gift Processing Coordinators at the bank, along with any cheques that won’t scan or cannot be scanned. The frequency of deposit may increase to twice a week when the volume requires it. The person doing the deposit completes the CIBC Deposit slip, initialing that they are doing the deposit, and adding the date of deposit. The cash is double counted by one of the Donor Relations and Gift Processing Coordinators, and initialed by both the person doing the deposit and the person who double counted. The first sheet of the deposit slip is included with the deposit, the remaining 2 sheets stay with the coupons, which are all filed in the “cash to be deposited” file.   
* Once the cash has been deposited, the person who completed the deposit will bring the receipt back to the Donor Services area, and include that receipt with the coupons and the CIBC Deposit Slip. The person who did the deposit will let the appropriate Donor Relations and Gift Processing Coordinator know that the batch is ready to be input into Raiser’s Edge.  
* The person who completed the deposit will then Notify Finance via email that a cash deposit was made and attach the CIBC bank report receipt to the email.  
* Refer to step 6 for completing this batch of donations after the cash has been deposited. 

**5\. Donations made by credit card** 

* Once you are ready to enter your batch of donations made by credit card, retrieve all slips from the filing cabinet drawer in the Donor Services Office. This should include direct mail coupons returned to us in the mail as well as credit card slips that have been filled while taking the information over the phone. These slips are secured in the filing cabinet in the Donor Services area after being taken over the phone.   
* Add up all the slips and create a tape to use as your projected count and amount.  
* Open Raiser’s Edge, and begin a new credit card batch following the “Gift Batching in Raiser’s Edge”.   
* Review the batch to ensure that there were no rejections.  
  * If there are rejections, write down the constituent ID, name, gift amount, and the rejection code. Delete them from the batch, remove their slips from the pile and update your tape. The Donor Relations and Gift Processing Coordinator will have to call the donors to confirm their payment information or send a Donor Service Letter.  
* Once the EFT transmission has taken place, print out the Transmission File – Credit Card report. For all credit cards that were approved and included in this batch, take a thick tip black permanent marker and black out all digits of the credit card number, with the exception of the last 4 digits. Wrap the Transmission File – Credit Card report around your coupons and credit card slips.    
* Commit the batch, and print the committed batch summary from Raiser’s Edge.   
* Highlight the batch number at the top of the document, and wrap it around the coupons/slips and the Credit Card report so the batch number is visible at the top of the bundle. File this bundle in the filing cabinet in the secure Donor Services office, by batch number.

**6\. Other Donations**   
 

* This final batch may include cash that has been deposited, cheques or bank drafts that would not scan through the CIBC cheque scanner so were deposited at the bank, and post-dated cheques.   
* Raiser’s Edge set-up: Open Raiser’s Edge, and create a new batch following the “Gift Batching in Raiser’s Edge”. We do not have the gift data to enter yet, so don’t start entering any information into the spreadsheet created by Raiser’s Edge – we only need the batch set-up at this point to create a batch number.   
* Collect your post-dated cheque(s) for that day’s deposit, and if applicable, the cash and cheques that were deposited at the bank. Complete the deposit log for each item being deposited, indicating the date of deposit, Raiser’s Edge batch number and sign your initials.   
* If this batch includes cash that has been deposited, you will also have an CIBC deposit slip and a receipt confirming the deposit. Bundle these together with the coupons/envelopes for these gifts.   
* Create two piles: one for the payment method (post-dated cheques and deposit slip/receipt from CIBC for the deposit of cheques that would not scan and cash), and one for the coupons/envelopes with the coding.   
* Ensure the total dollar value of each pile matches.   
* Deposit the post-dated cheque(s) in the Donor Account CIBC bank account using the CIBC Cheque scanner, following the same process as above.  
* Using the coupons from that deposit, enter the gifts into the batch you created in Raiser’s Edge.   
* Once you have entered all of the gifts, save and close the batch. Bring the coupons to the other Donor Relations and Gift Processing Coordinator for review an approval.  
* The Donor Relations and Gift Processing Coordinator will verify that the amount deposited to CIBC matches the total amount input in that Raiser’s Edge batch. The Donor Relations and Gift Processing Coordinator will also verify that all of the data was entered correctly into Raiser’s Edge then commit the batch.  
* Print the committed batch summary from Raiser’s Edge. Highlight the batch number at the top of the document, and wrap it around the RBC deposit details report so the batch number is visible at the top of the bundle. File this bundle in the filing cabinet in the secure Donor Services office, by batch number.
